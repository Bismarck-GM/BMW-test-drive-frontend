# BMW Test-Drive

> React/Redux Project where I developed a website and an API to set up Appointments to test-drive a car. The app depends on https://github.com/Bismarck-GM/BMW-test-drive-backend/ API to work. 
## Features:

### The website works both in Table-sized and Desktop-sized displays. There's no current Mobile version for it.
